# Classification-of-Eye-Diseases-Optical-Coherence-Tomography

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can detect macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema using the optical coherence tomography (OCT) method.

## Project Description

- Optical coherence tomography is an imaging technique that generates high-resolution images of eye tissues. These images provide important information for the diagnosis and monitoring of eye diseases. In this project, a deep learning model will be developed for the automatic detection of two significant eye diseases, namely macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.

- The deep learning model will take OCT images as input and undergo a learning process to classify diseases such as macular degeneration or diabetic macular edema. - The model will utilize deep neural networks to grasp the complexity of visual features and accurately identify eye diseases.

## The project will involve the following steps:

- Collection and preparation of OCT images.
- Design and training of the deep learning model.
- Testing the trained model on a validation dataset.
- Evaluation and improvement of the model's performance.
- Technologies Used

## The following technologies will be utilized in this project:

- Python programming language and popular libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Efficientnet, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV).
- Optical coherence tomography image datasets.
- Deep learning architectures and algorithms for model training.
